## Provisioning & custom hosts setup
You can use our provisioning template to setup your custom hosts.

1. place your hosts.conf files in povisioning/hosts/ and edit them regarding to your needs
2. open provisioning/setup/apache.sh and add code to enable/disable your custom hosts. This will ensure that your hosts only will be enabled if the directory exists.
3. if needed, copy your SSL certs to provisioning/ssl/ and link it in your custom hosts config file
4. restart vagrant with the provisioning flag and your vhosts will get enabled if the vhosts dir exists.

````nashorn js
vagrant reload --provision
````

### Switching PHP Versions in your custom hosts

Please include the following SetHandler directives in your custom vhost as seen in provisioning/hosts/100-myproject.conf.
After that, you can simply uncomment the requested line and reload your apache config (sudo service apache2 reload)

```
<FilesMatch \.php>
        SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php8.0-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        # SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        # SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        # SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        # SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        # SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
        # SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php5.6-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
</FilesMatch>
```

# Upgrade

### Upgrade from 3.0 to 3.1
if you don't want to use ***vagrant box upgrade*** you can run ***vagrant reload --provision*** instead.
This will run the commands in provisioning/setup/php.sh and install the newest versions of
- PHP 5.6 - PHP 8.0
- Composer

```bash
# if Jimmybox is running
vagrant reload --provision

# if Jimmybox is not running
vagrant up --provision
```

### Upgrade from older version
Please do not use vagrant box update if you are using jimmybox < 3.0! Create a new version instead an migrate your data manually.

# Known Issues

## NFS Share in MacOS 10.15 (Catalina) / MacOS 11 (Big Sur)
In Catalina (and sometimes Big Sur) NFS seems to have troubles finding a relative path in your synced folder.
You can avoid this if you just use an absolute Path (/Volumes/...)
```bash
config.vm.synced_folder "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/your-user/Sites", "/var/www", type: 'nfs', mount_options: ['rw', 'vers=3', 'tcp', 'fsc' ,'actimeo=1']
```

## MySQL 5.7 strict SQL mode?
We have disabled the strict SQL mode for better compatibility with older apps. You can simply enable it doing this:

```bash
vagrant ssh
sudo rm /etc/mysql/conf.d/disable_strict_mode.cnf
sudo service mysql restart
```

## Troubles with APCu?
In some cases, APCu can cause troubles. You can disable APCu using the following commands

```bash
vagrant ssh
sudo apt-get remove php-apcu
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## ioncube loader for PHP 8.0
by the date of the release the ioncube loader is not ready for PHP 8.0. We will implement this as soon if it's available.
