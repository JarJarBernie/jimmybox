## Switching PHP-Versions:

Jimmybox comes with preconfigured virtual hosts to use multiple PHP Versions from 5.6 to 7.2. Please just edit your local hosts file to use different PHP Versions.

#### Prepare your hosts file

```bash
# PHP 5.6
192.168.33.11  jimmy56.com

# PHP 7.0
192.168.33.11  jimmy70.com

# PHP 7.1
192.168.33.11  jimmy71.com

# PHP 7.2
192.168.33.11  jimmy72.com
```

#### open Jimmybox in your browser
1) PHP 7.2: http://jimmy72.com
2) PHP 7.1: http://jimmy71.com
3) PHP 7.0: http://jimmy70.com
4) PHP 5.6: http://jimmy56.com

## Need the MySQL 5.7 strict SQL mode?
We have disabled the strict SQL mode for better compatibility with older apps. You can simply enable it doing this:

```bash
vagrant ssh
sudo rm /etc/mysql/conf.d/disable_strict_mode.cnf
sudo service mysql restart
```

## Troubles with APCu?
In some cases, APCu could cause troubles. You can disable APCu using the following commands

```bash
vagrant ssh
sudo apt-get remove php-apcu
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## Vagrant sharing with ngrok.
vagrant share has been removed with Vagrant 2.0. We use ngrok instead to share our boxes. Jimmybox is pre-configured for ngrok.

Get started with ngrok here:
https://ngrok.com

You should customize the virtual hosts regarding to your needs

```bash
vagrant ssh
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available

# edit config file (f.e. 000-php7.1.conf)
sudo vim any-config-file.conf

# Change the ServerAlias or add your ngrok domain, for example
ServerAlias jimmy72.sternpunkt.ngrok.io

# after that, save the new settings and restart or reload your apache
sudo service apache2 reload
```
