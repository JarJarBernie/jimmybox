## Switching PHP-Versions:

Jimmybox comes with preconfigured virtual hosts to use multiple PHP Versions from 5.6 to 7.4. Please just edit your local hosts file to use different PHP Versions.

#### Prepare your hosts file

```bash
# PHP 7.4
192.168.33.11  jimmy74.com

# PHP 7.3
192.168.33.11  jimmy73.com

# PHP 7.2
192.168.33.11  jimmy72.com

# PHP 7.1
192.168.33.11  jimmy71.com

# PHP 7.0
192.168.33.11  jimmy70.com

# PHP 5.6
192.168.33.11  jimmy56.com
```

#### open Jimmybox in your browser
- PHP 7.4: http://jimmy74.com
- PHP 7.3: http://jimmy73.com
- PHP 7.2: http://jimmy72.com
- PHP 7.1: http://jimmy71.com
- PHP 7.0: http://jimmy70.com
- PHP 5.6: http://jimmy56.com

## Provisioning & custom hosts setup
You can use our provisioning template to setup your custom hosts.

1. place your hosts.conf files in povisioning/hosts/ and edit them regarding to your needs
2. open provisioning/setup/apache.sh and add code to enable/disable your custom hosts. This will ensure that your hosts only will be enabled if the directory exists.
3. if needed, copy your SSL certs to provisioning/ssl/ and link it in your custom hosts config file
4. restart vagrant with the provisioning flag and your vhosts will get enabled if the vhosts dir exists.

````nashorn js
vagrant reload --provision
````

## Need the MySQL 5.7 strict SQL mode?
We have disabled the strict SQL mode for better compatibility with older apps. You can simply enable it doing this:

```bash
vagrant ssh
sudo rm /etc/mysql/conf.d/disable_strict_mode.cnf
sudo service mysql restart
```

## Troubles with APCu?
In some cases, APCu can cause troubles. You can disable APCu using the following commands

```bash
vagrant ssh
sudo apt-get remove php-apcu
sudo service apache2 restart
```

## NFS Share in MacOS Catalina 10.15
In Catalina NFS seems to have troubles finding a relative path in your synced folder.
You can avoid this if you just use an absolute Path (/Volumes/...)
```bash
config.vm.synced_folder "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/your-user/Sites", "/var/www", type: 'nfs', mount_options: ['rw', 'vers=3', 'tcp', 'fsc' ,'actimeo=1']
```


## Vagrant sharing with ngrok.
vagrant share has been removed with Vagrant 2.0. We use ngrok instead to share our boxes. Jimmybox is pre-configured for ngrok.

Get started with ngrok here:
https://ngrok.com

You should customize the virtual hosts regarding to your needs

```bash
vagrant ssh
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available

# edit config file (f.e. 000-php7.1.conf)
sudo vim any-config-file.conf

# Change the ServerAlias or add your ngrok domain, for example
ServerAlias jimmy72.sternpunkt.ngrok.io

# after that, save the new settings and restart or reload your apache
sudo service apache2 reload
```

## upgrading from older Jimmybox Versions
Please do not use vagrant box update if you are using jimmybox 1.x! Better create a new version instead an migrate your data manually.
